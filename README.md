# Midnight.SOAP.SDK

## Overview

**Midnight.SOAP.SDK** is a .NET 8 library that provides a modern, strongly-typed interface for integrating with PrintReach's Midnight SOAP API. It simplifies authentication, request construction, and XML response parsing for all SOAP operations currently exposed. The SDK is designed for developers who need to interact with the Midnight API in a robust and maintainable way. 

*The SOAP API documentation from PrintReach can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YEIF8Jxqo1EHYi1ZAvqC1lAYNnkFGDT0/view) in PDF format.*

## Features

- **Full Midnight SOAP API Wrapper**: Retrieve, update, and insert any data supported by the Midnight SOAP API, including orders, inventory, customers, and more.
- **Strongly-Typed Requests**: Uses strongly-typed request objects to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors caused by string concatenated XML inputs.
- **Strongly-Typed Responses**: Converts Midnight API XML response strings into strongly-typed C# models.
- **User-Defined Fields Support**: The SDK provides a flexible UserDefinedFields class, where each UDF property (UDF1 to UDF30) is implemented using the `UDFValue` class. This allows each field to accept and serialize values as string, decimal, integer, date, or time, ensuring correct XML formatting for both requests and responses. The UDFValue class handles type conversion and serializes the value as the text content of the corresponding <UDF*> XML tag.
- **Testing** : Includes comprehensive unit tests for all services and request/response objects, ensuring reliability and correctness.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging for diagnostics and debugging using Serilog.

## XML Serialization and Null Properties

**Important:**  
To ensure correct XML serialization with the .NET `XmlSerializer`, nearly all properties in request objects are decorated with `XmlElement(IsNullable=true)`. This approach ensures that when a property is not explicitly set, it will be serialized as `xsi:nil="true"` in the XML payload, or omitted entirely, depending on the API requirements. This prevents unintended data from being sent to the Midnight SOAP API.

**Disclaimer:**
In the past, particularly with Update methods of the Midnight SOAP API, we have found instances where passing in `null` has instead removed the value from that property. If you encounter such a case, log an issue here and we will reach out to PrintReach Support for resolution.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- PrintReach Midnight MIS API access (developer token)
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (recommended)
- Serilog v4.3.0 or later for logging

### Installation
```
Install-Package Midnight.SOAP.SDK
```
---

## Usage

### 0. Soap Client Configuration
```csharp
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK.Utilities;

var soapClient = SoapClient.Configure();
```

### 1. Service Initializations
```csharp
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK;

var authService = new AuthenticationService(soapClient);
var customerService = new CustomerService(soapClient);
var customerContactService = new CustomerContactService(soapClient);
var djbService = new DJBService(soapClient);
var estimateService = new EstimateService(soapClient);
var inventoryItemService = new InventoryItemService(soapClient);
var inventoryService = new InventoryService(soapClient);
var jobCostingService = new JobCostingService(soapClient);
var orderService = new OrderService(soapClient);
var orderVersionService = new OrderVersionService(soapClient);
var orderVersionDetailService = new OrderVersionDetailService(soapClient);
var orderVersionDropService = new OrderVersionDropService(soapClient);
var orderVersionInventoryService = new OrderVersionInventoryService(soapClient);
var orderVersionPostageService = new OrderVersionPostageService(soapClient);

// ProofingService is the wrapper for "Request" api calls, making it clearer what the service is used for.
var proofingService = new ProofingService(soapClient);

var purchaseOrderService = new PurchaseOrderService(soapClient);
var settingsService = new SettingService(soapClient);
var venderService = new VendorService(soapClient);
var vendorContactService = new VendorContactService(soapClient);

```

### 2. Authentication
**IMPORTANT: Never expose your developer token in client-side code or public repositories. Use a secrets manager or json configuration files that are in the .gitignore file**
- So long as your team has purchased API access from PrintReach for Midnight MIS, you can find your dev token in Admin Settings > Global Settings > Site Token.
```csharp
var validationHeader = await authService.AuthenticateAsync("your-dev-token");
```

### 3. User Defined Fields Example
User Defined Fields (UDFs) are supported in all services that accept or return UDFs. The `UserDefinedFields` class contains properties for UDF1 to UDF30, each of which is of type `UDFValue`. The `UDFValue` class can hold values of different types (string, decimal, integer, date, time) and ensures proper serialization/deserialization to XML. 

***NOTE: In scenarios where only a portion of available UDFs are available to send in a request or receive in a response, those classes inherit either `UserDefinedFields_Top10` or `UserDefinedFields_Top5` classes.***

```csharp
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK.CommonObjects;

var customerInsertUDFs = new UserDefinedFields
{
    UDF7 = new UDFValue { Value = (decimal)0.999 }, // decimal type in Midnight UDF setup
    UDF11 = new UDFValue { Value = 12345 }, // csharp auto-recognizes this as an integer
    UDF1 = new UDFValue { Value = "testStringUDFInput" }, // csharp auto-recognizes this as a string 
    UDF5 = new UDFValue { Value = (decimal)999.00 } // currency-type field within Midnight UDF setup
};

var customerInsertResult = await customerService.CustomerInsertAsync(auth, new CustomerInsertRequestBody
{
    InputParameter = new CustomerInsertInputParameter
    {
        CustomerCode = "TESTCUSTOMER1234",
        CustomerName = "TEST CUSTOMER 123",
        UDF7 = customerInsertUDFs.UDF7,
        UDF11 = customerInsertUDFs.UDF11,
        UDF1 = customerInsertUDFs.UDF1,
        UDF5 = customerInsertUDFs.UDF5
    }
});
```

### 4. Retrieve Order Version List by Customer
A common thing that you might need to do is retrieve a list of customers, then for each customer retrieve a list of orders, and for each order retrieve a list of order versions to then update version details/drops/postage etc. Below is an example of how to accomplish this using the SDK.

```csharp
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK;
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK.Utilities;
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK.CommonObjects;
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK.RequestObjects.CustomerInputs;
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK.RequestObjects.OrderInputs;
using Midnight.SOAP.SDK.RequestObjects.VersionInputs;


var soapClient = SoapClient.Configure();
var authService = new AuthenticationService(soapClient);
var customerService = new CustomerService(soapClient);
var orderService = new OrderService(soapClient);
var orderVersionService = new OrderVersionService(soapClient);
var validationHeader = await authService.AuthenticateAsync("your-dev-token");


var customerListInput = new CustomerListRequestBody { /* set properties */ };
var customerListResult = await customerService.CustomerListAsync(validationHeader, customerListInput);

foreach (var customer in customerListResult.Customers)
{
    var orderListInput = new OrderListRequestBody { /* set properties from customer */ };
    var orderListResult = await orderService.OrderListAsync(validationHeader, orderListInput); 

    // Error check result
    
    // filter orders as needed based on Result object
    var filteredOrders = orderListResult.Orders.Where(
        o => o.ProjectName.Contains("SomeFilter")).ToList();
    
    foreach (var order in filteredOrders.Orders)
    {
        var versionListInput = new OrderVersionListRequestBody { /* set properties from order */ };
        var versionListResult = await orderVersionService.OrderVersionListAsync(validationHeader, versionListInput);

        // Error check result

        foreach (var version in versionListResult.OrderVersions)
        {
            // Process each order version as needed
            // List/Update/Insert things like OrderVersionDetails, Drops, Inventory, Postage, etc.
        }
    }
}
```

## Errors and Exceptions
The SDK uses a combination of exceptions and error messages within the result objects to indicate errors. The inheritance of `CommonResult` for all output objects ensures the ReturnCode and ReturnErrors object are consistently available across all service responses.

### Error Example
```csharp
...
    ReturnCode = -1, // Non-zero indicates an error
    ReturnErrors = 
    {
        Error = "Invalid authentication token." ,
        Error = "CustomerCode is required." 
    }
...
```

### Exceptions
The SDK will throw exceptions immediately after a non-zero ReturnCode is detected in the response. The ReturnCode and ReturnErrors properties are logged when this occurs. 

#### Exceptions Possible
- `ArgumentNullException`: Thrown when a required parameter is null.
- `InvalidOperationException`: Thrown when an operation is attempted that is not valid for the current state of the object.
- `AuthenticationException`: Thrown when authentication fails.
- `Exception`: Thrown for general errors that do not fit other categories.

## Commit Message and Branch Naming Conventions

### Conventional Commit Messages
All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, which is compatible with automated versioning tools like Versionize and GitVersion. Example formats:

- `feat!: add support for NuGet deploy and release`
- `fix: correct null reference in authentication service`
- `docs: update API usage section in README`
- `refactor(service): simplify request logic`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `test: add unit tests for AuthenticationService`

### Branch Naming Conventions
Branches must follow the enforced naming contract:

- `feature-new-api-integration`
- `bugfix-fix-authentication-error`
- `hotfix-critical-production-issue`
- `docs-update-readme`
- `refactor-service-layer`
- `chore-update-dependencies`
- `test-add-auth-tests`
- `build-update-ci-workflow`
- `release-v1.2.3`
- `merge-main-into-feature`

> Branch names must match the pattern: `^(feature|bugfix|hotfix|docs|refactor|chore|test|experimental|build|release|merge)-[a-z0-9._-]+$`

These conventions are enforced by git hooks and the CI/CD workflow to ensure consistency and compatibility with automated versioning and changelog generation.
